**[1. Purpose]{.underline}**

The first process to run to proceed with correlation, clustering, and
was Excel\'s data preprocessing. Data preprocessing was carried out
independent attributes (X = 32 attributes) and dependent variables (Y =
228 data points). Correlation analysis was conducted because it was
necessary to know how closely the crime rate and each label (0,1,2,3,4)
value were related to the remaining 32 attributes.

Through data analytics, we will find factors that are highly correlated
with the crime rate, and visualize the crime rate of vulnerable areas.

Why? In order to propose preventive measures for crime.

**[2. Correlation Analysis]{.underline}**

In the correlation analysis we used the pearson method. As a result, a
graph of correlation analysis for covariance and a graph of p-value were
obtained.

The following code is for correlation analysis.

The following graph is a graph of correlation coefficient and p-value.

We compare the number of 5 major crimes to other attributes. By
comparing, we can find the correlation coefficient between the number of
5 major crimes and other attributes. First of all, if you look at the
p-value graph above, it mostly consists of values less than 0.05. This
means that anything lower than 0.05 is highly correlated. There were 8
attributes that were really irrelevant. The attributes that were not
related to the number of 5 major crimes were the number of cctv per
10,000 people, the number of social enterprises per 100,000 people, the
number of childcare facilities per 1,000 infants and toddlers, the
number of beds at medical institutions per 1,000 people, satisfaction
with using leisure time, the number of leisure facilities related to
sports per 1,000 people, fine dust, traffic accidents and fires among
the current status of local safety ratings. Next is the correlation
coefficient graph. The correlation coefficient must be between 1 and -1.
If the absolute value of correlation coefficient is closer to 1, it
means that attribute is more correlated with independent variable X. We
found that security satisfaction and the number of doctors working at
medical institutions per 1,000 people are highly correlated to the
number of 5 major crimes, in contrast to other attributes.

**[3. Clustering]{.underline}**

Referring to the scree plot, we concluded that the elbow point should be
set to 5. So we carried out non-hierarchical analysis using the 'K-means
method'. The result of classifying each data into 5 clusters are as
follows.

![](media/image10.png){width="6.267716535433071in"
height="3.3333333333333335in"}

We classified the cluster with a high crime rate into 'cluster4' and the
smaller crime rate, the smaller index is put on, arranged in 'cluster0'.

To determine how the five clusters were divided, we analyzed each data
and select for three features whose value is highly normalized.

Cluster 0 appeared yellow. "노인 천명당 노인 여가 복지 시설 수", "인구
십만명 당 학교 수", "도시 지역 중 녹지비율" values are high in cluster
0.

Cluster 1 appeared deep yellow. "치안 만족도", "1인당 담당 인구, "경찰
출동시간(분)" values are high in cluster 1.

cluster 2 appeared orange. "주민 1인당 생황 폐기물 배출량", "1인 가구
수", "빈집수"

Cluster 3 and Cluster 4 have "독거노인가구 비율" in common. It suggest
that high "독거노인가구비율" is related to high incidence of crime. In
contrast to, Cluster 0 has "노인 천명 당 노인 여가 복지 시설 수". So we
suppose that a descriptor concerning "elder people", like number of
leisure welfare facilities for the elderly per 1,000 elderly people, the
proportion of elderly to the population of the region, will be
correlated to the crime rate.

Also they have "교원 1인당 학생수" commonly. It means the number of
students per a teacher is more than other regions belong to cluster
0,1,2. So a teacher can't care for all students, so that students may
not receive enough education.

**[4. Regression]{.underline}**

When performing cluster analysis, according to Elbow k-means clustering,
it was ideal to divide the cluster into six groups.

The float type of the array shown next graph is 32, and the first to 227
datasets mean regions. The cluster was divided int 6 cluster, cluster 0,
cluster 1, cluster 2, cluster 3, cluster 4, cluster 5. For
visualization, each cluster was classified into which region it belongs
to.

This is the result of the analysis of the target attribute \'five major
crimes\'. The fact that can be seen from P\>ltl can be seen by using the
t distribution to determine how significant each variable is. The
R-square value means the square of R and the coefficient of
determination. It is the explanatory power of the regression line for
the original data, and the higher the data, the better. The r-square
value has a value between 0 and 1, and if it is 0, the model has no
explanatory power, and if it is 1, it can be seen that the model
perfectly. Since a value of 0.757 came out in this model, it can be seen
that the model explains the data well. Adj. R-square is a modification
decision coefficient and is used in multiple regression analysis with
multiple independent variables. R-square is guaranteed by considering
the number of independent variables and the size of the sample.

As a result of the analysis of the Target attribute \"five major
crimes,\" excluding cities and counties, CCTV per 10,000 people, social
enterprises per 100,000 people, childcare facilities per 1,000 infants,
medical institution beds per 1,000 people, green area ratio, cultural
infrastructure, leisure facilities, and fine dust showed a probability
(P-Value) of less than 0.05. It can be seen that these properties are
reliable.

Results: We have to investigate the red cluster.

Rather than ending with cluster analysis, we use a deep neural network
to set 159 regional data for label weights as train_set, and use the
remaining ratio 3 as test_set to find out how many weights are in the
weight values within 0 to 12.

It consists of one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer.
The hidden layer\'s sense is set to 12, and the input shape is set to
43.

Of the 227 data, 159 were classified as training sets and the rest as
test sets. Y_test\[0\] refers to the 0th data in the test set. We put
test data in X_new to input data, which shows that each y_ped is
perfectly consistent. This indicates that the model is good from the
point data of the test set (label = 11.4).

Without early stopping, the validation loss increases near the 90th
epoch. To prevent overfitting, it

**[5. Interpretation]{.underline}**

Before the project, attributes such as the number of cctvs, the number
of police stations, or single-person households were expected to be
highly related to the number of five major crimes, but as a result of
comparing and analyzing the number of other 31 attributes, they were
found to be highly related to the elderly. Therefore, it can be
concluded that measures related to the elderly, such as increasing the
number of elderly leisure welfare facilities are necessary, but due to
the large number of natural or other unknown variables, increasing the
number of elderly leisure welfare facilities with the highest
correlation coefficient cannot guarantee the decrease of the crime rate.
